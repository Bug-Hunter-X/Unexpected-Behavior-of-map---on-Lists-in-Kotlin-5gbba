This example demonstrates a common misunderstanding of the `map()` function in Kotlin when applied to lists.  The `map()` function in Kotlin is designed to be immutable, creating a new list with transformed elements rather than modifying the original.  This behavior can be unexpected for developers accustomed to mutable operations. The provided solution clarifies how to achieve in-place modification using `map` with the `mapTo` function if needed, otherwise, you must explicitly assign the new list returned by the `map` function to a new variable.
